# Data-Structures-Made-Easier
This is a quick guide to both beginners and middle level programmers on how to tackle data structures and algorithm. Most of the documents in this repo will be code, but the good part is that the code will have some short notes inside explaining how everything written in the code works.
Hope you find it interesting learning from this and make a further step of even learning more by your own and even researching further so as to enhance on your coding skills.
Always remember that grasping the basics is the key to creating a better programmer/software engineer in yourself.
